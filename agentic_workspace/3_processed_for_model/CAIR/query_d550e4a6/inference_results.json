        "img_txt_result": "Okay, let's analyze the image and text according to the provided steps.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 1: Sentiment Alignment\n\n1. **Text Sentiment**: The text conveys a factual announcement, but with a slight potential for inconvenience or disruption. It's primarily *neutral* with a hint of potential negative impact (banks being closed).\n2. **Image Sentiment**: The image of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) building evokes a sense of stability, authority, and formality. It's generally *neutral* and professional.\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Classification: `Sentiment Aligned`\n    - Reasoning: Both the text and the image present a neutral tone. The text is a factual announcement, and the image depicts a symbol of a stable financial institution. There's no strong emotional content in either.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 2: Entity Consistency\n\n1. **Text Entities**: The text mentions \"RBI\" (Reserve Bank of India) and \"banks.\"\n2. **Image Entities**: The image prominently features the RBI logo and the building of the Reserve Bank of India.\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Classification: `Entities Aligned`\n    - Reasoning: The primary entity mentioned in the text, the RBI, is clearly and visually represented in the image. The reference to \"banks\" is consistent with the image depicting the central bank.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 3: Event/Action Consistency\n\n1. **Text Event/Action**: The text describes a new rule where banks will be closed on Saturdays and Sundays.\n2. **Image Depiction**: The image shows the exterior of the RBI building. It doesn't depict any specific action or event related to bank closures. It's a static representation of the institution.\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Classification: `Event/Action Ambiguous/Unverifiable`\n    - Reasoning: The image doesn't visually represent the event of banks being closed. It simply shows the building of the RBI. The event is not depicted.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 4: Final Judgment\n\n- Judgment: `TRUE`\n- Brief Reasoning: While the image doesn't directly depict the event described in the text (bank closures), the strong alignment in sentiment and entity consistency suggests the image is relevant and truthful in its pairing with the text. The image reinforces the context of the news \u2013 the Reserve Bank of India \u2013 which is the subject of the announcement. The lack of a visual depiction of the event is not enough to deem the pairing as false.",
        "qimg_eimg_result": "Okay, let's analyze the two images provided.\n\n**STEP 1: Sentiment Alignment**\n\n*   **Image 1 Sentiment**: The image of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) building conveys a sense of stability, authority, and formality. It's largely neutral, but with a subtle undertone of institutional power.\n*   **Image 2 Sentiment**: The image of Narendra Modi speaking passionately appears to convey energy, conviction, and perhaps even a degree of urgency or intensity.\n*   **Comparison**: `Sentiment Mismatch`\n*   **Reasoning**: The RBI image projects a calm, institutional feel, while the image of Modi conveys a more dynamic and emotionally charged atmosphere. These sentiments are quite different.\n\n**STEP 2: Entity Consistency**\n\n*   **Entities in Image 1**: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) - an organization, and the building itself is a recognizable location.\n*   **Entities in Image 2**: Narendra Modi - a person (Prime Minister of India).\n*   **Comparison**: `Entities Mismatch`\n*   **Reasoning**: While both images relate to India, the specific entities depicted are different. One focuses on a financial institution, the other on a political figure.\n\n**STEP 3: Event/Action Consistency**\n\n*   **Event/Action in Image 1**: The image depicts the exterior of the RBI headquarters, suggesting a focus on the institution itself, its operations, or perhaps a policy decision.\n*   **Event/Action in Image 2**: The image shows Narendra Modi giving a speech, likely addressing a political rally or public gathering.\n*   **Comparison**: `Event/Action Mismatch`\n*   **Reasoning**: The events depicted are entirely different. One is related to finance and banking, the other to politics and public speaking.\n\n**STEP 4: Final Judgment**\n\n*   **Judgment**: FAKE\n*   **Brief Reasoning**: The combination of these images is likely misleading. The sentiment mismatch, entity mismatch, and event/action mismatch strongly suggest that the images are being presented together to create a false or misleading narrative. There's no inherent connection between the RBI and Narendra Modi in these images, and pairing them could be intended to imply a relationship that doesn't exist or to manipulate the viewer's perception. The sentiment mismatch is particularly telling.",
        "claim_verification_str": "The claim is LIKELY FAKE with support score 0.0.",
        "final_response": "**Final Classification**: FAKE\n**Detailed Reasoning**:\n\nThe final classification is FAKE, with high confidence, primarily driven by the strong negative score from the web-based claim verification (Evidence 3). The web search indicates a very low level of support for the claim that banks will be closed on every Saturday and Sunday, suggesting it is likely false.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how each piece of evidence contributed to this conclusion:\n\n**Arguments FOR FAKE Classification:**\n\n*   **Strongest Argument (Evidence 3):** The web search results provide a strong indication that the claim is false. A low support score of 0.0 suggests that no credible news sources are reporting this change in banking hours. This is the most significant factor in the decision.\n*   **Supporting Argument (Evidence 2):** The image-image analysis revealed a significant mismatch between the two images. The RBI building image conveys stability and formality, while the image of Narendra Modi conveys a dynamic and political atmosphere. This incongruity suggests the images are being used out of context or to create a misleading narrative. The lack of any logical connection between the two images further supports the idea that the post is fabricated.\n*   **Minor Argument (Evidence 1):** While the image-text analysis showed some alignment in sentiment and entities, it also noted that the image doesn't depict the event itself (bank closures). This lack of visual confirmation, combined with the other evidence, weakens the argument for authenticity.\n\n**Arguments AGAINST FAKE Classification:**\n\n*   **Minor Argument (Evidence 1):** The initial image-text analysis did find some alignment in sentiment and entities. The RBI building is relevant to the topic of banking, and the neutral tone of both the image and text doesn't immediately raise red flags. However, this is a weak argument given the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the overwhelming evidence from the web search (Evidence 3) strongly indicates that the claim is false. The image-image analysis (Evidence 2) further supports this conclusion by highlighting the incongruity of the paired images. While the image-text analysis (Evidence 1) showed some initial alignment, it is not sufficient to override the stronger evidence pointing to the post being fake.",
