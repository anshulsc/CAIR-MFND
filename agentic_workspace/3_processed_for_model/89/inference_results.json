        "img_txt_result": "Okay, let's analyze the image and text provided.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 1: Sentiment Alignment\n\n1. **Text Sentiment**: The text describes a \"scam\" and an \"investigation,\" which carries a negative and serious tone. It suggests wrongdoing and official action to address it.\n2. **Image Sentiment**: The image shows the emblem of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of India. The CBI is a law enforcement agency, and its emblem conveys authority, seriousness, and a sense of official process. It doesn't inherently express emotion, but its association with law enforcement implies a formal and potentially serious context.\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Classification: `Sentiment Aligned`\n    - Reasoning: Both the text and the image convey a serious and formal tone. The text describes a negative event (a scam) being investigated, and the image represents the investigating authority.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 2: Entity Consistency\n\n1. **Text Entities**:\n    *   CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation)\n    *   Maharashtra (State in India)\n2. **Image Entities**: The image prominently features the CBI emblem.\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Classification: `Entities Aligned`\n    - Reasoning: The CBI, a key entity mentioned in the text, is clearly depicted in the image. While Maharashtra isn't visually represented, the image's association with the CBI provides context for the text's mention of the state.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 3: Event/Action Consistency\n\n1. **Text Event/Action**: The main event is the initiation of an investigation by the CBI into a \"bitcoin scam.\"\n2. **Image Depiction**: The image doesn't depict the scam itself or the investigation. It simply shows the CBI emblem, representing the agency involved in the investigation.\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Classification: `Event/Action Ambiguous/Unverifiable`\n    - Reasoning: The image doesn't visually represent the event or action described in the text. It's a symbolic representation of the investigating body, not the event itself.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 4: Final Judgment\n\n- Judgment: `TRUE`\n- Brief Reasoning: While the image doesn't directly depict the event, the strong alignment in sentiment and the clear presence of the CBI (a key entity) strongly suggest the image is relevant and truthful in its pairing with the text. The lack of a direct depiction of the event doesn't invalidate the connection; it simply provides context and reinforces the authority involved in the investigation. The Entity Consistency and Sentiment Alignment analyses are the most significant contributors to this judgment.",
        "qimg_eimg_result": "Okay, let's analyze the two images provided.\n\n**STEP 1: Sentiment Alignment**\n\n*   **Image 1 Sentiment**: The image of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) logo evokes a sense of authority, investigation, and potentially seriousness or concern, depending on the context. It's generally a neutral to slightly serious sentiment.\n*   **Image 2 Sentiment**: The image of a Bitcoin with fluctuating charts conveys volatility, risk, and potentially financial instability or uncertainty. It has a slightly negative sentiment due to the downward trend in the charts.\n*   **Comparison**: `Sentiment Mismatch`\n*   **Reasoning**: The CBI image suggests a formal investigation or authority, while the Bitcoin image conveys financial risk and instability. These sentiments are not aligned.\n\n**STEP 2: Entity Consistency**\n\n*   **Entities in Image 1**: CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation), India (implied by the logo).\n*   **Entities in Image 2**: Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency (implied by the Bitcoin symbol and charts).\n*   **Comparison**: `Entities Mismatch`\n*   **Reasoning**: The entities in the two images are completely different. One relates to a government investigative agency, and the other relates to cryptocurrency.\n\n**STEP 3: Event/Action Consistency**\n\n*   **Event/Action in Image 1**: The image depicts the logo of the CBI, suggesting an investigation or official action related to law enforcement.\n*   **Event/Action in Image 2**: The image depicts the fluctuating value of Bitcoin, suggesting financial market activity and volatility.\n*   **Comparison**: `Event/Action Mismatch`\n*   **Reasoning**: The events depicted are unrelated. One is about a government investigation, and the other is about cryptocurrency market trends.\n\n**STEP 4: Final Judgment**\n\n*   **Judgment**: FAKE\n*   **Brief Reasoning**: All three analyses (Sentiment, Entities, and Event/Action) indicate a significant mismatch between the images. The combination of the CBI logo and a Bitcoin image is likely intended to mislead viewers into believing there's a connection between the agency and cryptocurrency, which is not inherently evident from the images themselves. The lack of alignment across all dimensions strongly suggests manipulation or a misleading pairing.",
        "claim_verification_str": "The claim is TRUE with support score 20.0.",
        "final_response": "**Final Classification**: REAL\n**Detailed Reasoning**:\n\nThe final classification is REAL, with a high confidence level. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning, prioritizing the evidence as instructed:\n\n**Primary Support (Evidence 3 - Web Search):** The web search provides a \"High Support\" score of 20.0, indicating strong factual basis for the claim that the CBI is investigating a Rs 6,600-crore Maharashtra \"bitcoin scam.\" This is the most significant piece of evidence and heavily influences the final judgment. Multiple news sources corroborate this investigation.\n\n**Secondary Support (Evidence 1 - Image-Text):** The image-text analysis reveals a strong alignment in sentiment and entities. The CBI emblem in the image aligns with the text's mention of the CBI, and both convey a serious tone appropriate for a financial investigation. While the image doesn't depict the scam itself, its presence reinforces the context of an official investigation.\n\n**Contradictory Evidence (Evidence 2 - Image-Image):** The image-image analysis flags a significant mismatch. The combination of the CBI logo and a Bitcoin image is incongruous and suggests potential manipulation. However, this evidence is given moderate weight. The fact that the web search strongly supports the claim overrides the visual inconsistency. It's possible the image was chosen to sensationalize the story or create confusion, but the underlying claim itself is verified. The image-image analysis highlights a potential issue with the presentation of the news, but not necessarily the veracity of the claim itself.\n\n**Overall:** While the image pairing in Evidence 2 raises concerns about potential misleading presentation, the overwhelming support from the web search (Evidence 3) and the reasonable alignment between the image and text (Evidence 1) lead to the conclusion that the news post is reporting a real event. The visual inconsistency is likely a separate issue related to the image selection rather than a fabrication of the core claim.",

            "Here's an analysis of the rationales, grouped by factual alignment, followed by a summary:\n\n**1. Factually Aligned (Supports Sentence A):**\n\n*   **Rationale 1:** Both describe the CBI initiating an investigation into the Rs 6,600-crore 'bitcoin scam' in Maharashtra.\n*   **Rationale 2:** Both report the CBI initiating a probe into the Maharashtra 'bitcoin scam', with Sentence B indicating the start of the investigation through summons.\n*   **Rationale 3:** Both refer to the CBI initiating an investigation into the 'bitcoin scam' in Maharashtra; Sentence B confirms the FIR, aligning with \"begins probe.\"\n*   **Rationale 4:** Both describe the CBI initiating a probe into the Rs 6,600-crore alleged bitcoin scam in Maharashtra, with a case registered against 2 individuals.\n*   **Rationale 5:** Both refer to the CBI initiating a probe into the alleged Maharashtra 'bitcoin scam'; Sentence B confirms the FIR.\n*   **Rationale 7:** Both relate to the CBI's investigation into the Rs 6,600-crore GainBitcoin crypto scam, with Sentence B confirming raids.\n\n**2. Factually Contradictory (Disputes Sentence A):**\n\n*   **Rationale 8:** Describes ED raids on fake bank accounts, a different case than the CBI's 'bitcoin scam' investigation.\n*   **Rationale 9:** Discusses ED seizing crypto in Gujarat related to the BitConnect scam, a different event and location than the Maharashtra 'bitcoin scam'.\n*   **Rationale 10:** Describes ED raids related to a bank fraud of Rs 100 crore, a different case than the CBI's 'bitcoin scam'.\n\n**3. Partially Aligned/Weak Alignment (Requires Caution):**\n\n*   **Rationale 6:** Sentence B only mentions the CBI probe, omitting the Rs 6,600 crore amount and the number of individuals involved. While related, it lacks key details from Sentence A.\n\n\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe evidence largely supports Sentence A, with several rationales confirming the CBI's investigation into the Rs 6,600-crore 'bitcoin scam' in Maharashtra. However, a significant portion of the evidence (Rationales 8, 9, and 10) describes separate investigations by the ED concerning different financial crimes and locations, demonstrating that Sentence A is not universally supported. Rationale 6 highlights a partial alignment, as it confirms the probe but lacks crucial details mentioned in Sentence A, suggesting a need for caution when interpreting its support. Overall, while the core claim of a CBI probe is corroborated, the specific details (amount and individuals) are not consistently present across all evidence."
