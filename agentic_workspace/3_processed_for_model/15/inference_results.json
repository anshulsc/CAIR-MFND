        "img_txt_result": "Okay, let's analyze the provided news sample step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 1: Sentiment Alignment\n\n1. **Text Sentiment**: The text expresses a positive and celebratory sentiment. Phrases like \"most awaited\" and \"after decades of fight\" indicate excitement and triumph.\n2. **Image Sentiment**: The image presents a more complex sentiment. While the person depicted (Narendra Modi) appears serious, the prominent \"VETO\" stamp overlaid on a document creates a sense of disapproval or rejection. The red color of the stamp also carries a negative connotation.\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Classification: `Sentiment Mismatch`\n    - Reasoning: The text conveys a positive sentiment of achievement, while the image, with the \"VETO\" stamp, suggests a rejection or denial, creating a conflicting emotional tone.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 2: Entity Consistency\n\n1. **Text Entities**: The text mentions \"India.\"\n2. **Image Entities**: The image clearly depicts Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India. The logo on the document appears to be the emblem of India.\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Classification: `Entities Aligned`\n    - Reasoning: The text refers to India, and the image features Narendra Modi (a key representative of India) and the Indian emblem.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 3: Event/Action Consistency\n\n1. **Text Event/Action**: The text describes India gaining veto power after a long struggle.\n2. **Image Depiction**: The image depicts Narendra Modi holding a document with a \"VETO\" stamp. This suggests an action of rejecting or vetoing something, not gaining it.\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Classification: `Event/Action Mismatch`\n    - Reasoning: The text describes an acquisition of power (veto power), while the image depicts an act of vetoing, which is the opposite.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 4: Final Judgment\n\n- Judgment: `FAKE`\n- Brief Reasoning: The most significant factor in this judgment is the `Event/Action Mismatch`. The text claims India *gained* veto power, while the image visually represents an action of *vetoing* something. This contradiction strongly suggests the image is being used to misrepresent the news or create a misleading narrative. The sentiment mismatch further reinforces this conclusion. While the entities are aligned, the core event described is completely opposite to what the image portrays.",
        "qimg_eimg_result": "Okay, let's analyze the two images step-by-step.\n\n**STEP 1: Sentiment Alignment**\n\n*   **Image 1 Sentiment**: The image conveys a negative sentiment. The prominent \"VETO\" stamp overlaid on a document, combined with the serious expression on Narendra Modi's face, suggests disapproval or rejection.\n*   **Image 2 Sentiment**: The image has a neutral sentiment. It presents information about the \"Veto Powers of President of India\" with a formal and informative tone. The woman's expression is calm and professional.\n*   **Comparison**: `Sentiment Mismatch`\n*   **Reasoning**: Image 1 expresses a negative sentiment related to a veto decision, while Image 2 presents a neutral, informational context about veto powers.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 2: Entity Consistency**\n\n*   **Entities in Image 1**: Narendra Modi (prominently featured), the Indian government (indicated by the emblem), and a document.\n*   **Entities in Image 2**: Droupadi Murmu (President of India), the Indian government (implied by the context), and the office of the President.\n*   **Comparison**: `Entities Mismatch`\n*   **Reasoning**: While both images relate to the Indian government, the primary entities are different: Narendra Modi in Image 1 and Droupadi Murmu in Image 2.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 3: Event/Action Consistency**\n\n*   **Event/Action in Image 1**: The image depicts Narendra Modi seemingly rejecting or vetoing a document. The visual emphasis is on the act of vetoing.\n*   **Event/Action in Image 2**: The image presents information about the veto powers held by the President of India. It's an explanatory graphic, not a depiction of an action.\n*   **Comparison**: `Event/Action Mismatch`\n*   **Reasoning**: Image 1 shows an action (vetoing), while Image 2 describes a power (veto power). They represent different aspects of the same concept.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 4: Final Judgment**\n\n*   **Judgment**: FAKE\n*   **Brief Reasoning**: The combination of the images is misleading. Image 1 implies that Narendra Modi is vetoing something, while Image 2 explains the veto powers of the President. The pairing suggests a connection that doesn't exist, potentially creating a false narrative. The sentiment mismatch and event/action mismatch are the most significant factors contributing to this judgment. The images are likely being used to create a misleading impression.",
        "claim_verification_str": "The claim is LIKELY FAKE with support score 0.0.",
        "final_response": "**Final Classification**: FAKE\n**Detailed Reasoning**:\n\nThe overwhelming evidence points towards the news post being fake. The primary driver of this conclusion is **Evidence 3 (Web Search)**, which indicates a \"LIKELY FAKE\" claim with a very low support score (0.0). This means that a web search for the claim \"India got the most awaited VETO Power after decades of fight...\" reveals no credible news sources supporting this statement. This is a strong indicator of fabrication.\n\n**FOR FAKE Classification:**\n\n*   **Strongest Evidence: Web Search (Evidence 3)** - The lack of any supporting news reports directly contradicts the claim, making it highly suspect.\n*   **Image-Text Inconsistency (Evidence 1)** - The text celebrates India *gaining* veto power, while the image depicts Narendra Modi seemingly *vetoing* something. This fundamental contradiction is a major red flag. The sentiment mismatch further reinforces this.\n*   **Image-Image Inconsistency (Evidence 2)** - The comparison with a graphic explaining veto powers held by the President highlights the misleading nature of the image. The image is presented as an action (vetoing) while the graphic explains a power.\n*   The visual of Narendra Modi with a \"VETO\" stamp is likely a manipulated image designed to create a false impression.\n\n**AGAINST FAKE Classification:**\n\n*   **Entity Alignment (Evidence 1 & 2)** - Both the image and text correctly identify India and key figures associated with the Indian government (Narendra Modi and Droupadi Murmu). However, this alignment of entities doesn't negate the core inconsistencies in the event/action being described.\n*   The image itself is visually plausible, which could initially deceive someone unfamiliar with image manipulation techniques. However, this is a superficial observation and doesn't outweigh the stronger evidence.\n\n**Confidence Level**: High. The combination of a lack of supporting evidence from web searches, a clear contradiction between the text and image, and the misleading nature of the image's visual representation leaves little doubt that this news post is fabricated.",

            "Here's an analysis of the rationales and a summary of the findings:\n\n**Factual Alignment:**\n\n*   **None.** No Sentence B is deemed factually aligned with Sentence A. The rationales consistently highlight differences in the facts presented.\n\n**Contradictory:**\n\n*   **Sentence B discussing obstacles to India joining the UN Security Council and acquiring veto power:** This is the closest to a contradiction. While related to the topic of India and the UN Security Council, it presents an ongoing challenge *preventing* the acquisition of veto power, directly contrasting Sentence A's claim of having *obtained* it.\n\n**Unrelated:**\n\n*   **Sentence B stating the President of India has veto power:** This describes an existing authority, not a recent acquisition.\n*   **Sentence B discussing population control measures:** Completely different topic.\n*   **Sentence B posing a question about when/how India will get veto power:**  An inquiry versus an assertion.\n*   **Sentence B stating the BJP is responding to something:**  A political reaction, not a claim about power.\n*   **Sentence B mentioning Lucknow and Patna:** Geographical references, unrelated to the political claim.\n*   **Sentence B being a link to the Aam Aadmi Party's website:** Irrelevant external link.\n*   **Sentence B discussing the weather and best time to visit Delhi:** Completely different topic.\n*   **Sentence B discussing a proposal for 'one nation one election':** Different political topic.\n\n\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe provided evidence overwhelmingly **disputes** Sentence A's claim that India has \"finally got\" veto power.  None of the Sentence Bs offer factual support for this assertion; instead, they either describe existing authority, unrelated topics, or present obstacles to India acquiring veto power. The closest to a contradiction is the Sentence B discussing challenges to joining the UN Security Council, as it implies the power hasn't been obtained. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that Sentence A is inaccurate or misleading."
