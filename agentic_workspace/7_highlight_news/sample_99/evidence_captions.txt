The upper caste Ashraf Muslims in AP’s Guntur have demolished with full impunity the dargah revered by BC Nagoor Meera & Dudekula Pasmanda Muslims. I strongly condemn the act of snatching away the religious rights of BC Muslims & demand strict action against the perpetrators.

The upper caste Ashraf Muslims in AP’s Guntur have demolished with full impunity the dargah revered by BC Nagoor Meera & Dudekula Pasmanda Muslims. I strongly condemn the act of snatching away the religious rights of BC Muslims & demand strict action against the perpetrators. Our syncretic culture, inspired by the values of Sanatan Dharm, has always taught the values of acceptance and (not tolerance, as it has got negative connotations). We believe faiths to be true, but condemn those who try to impose their beliefs on other. That is why we are for Abdul Kalam and against Mohd Ali Jinnah and Kasab. There are 10000 such dargahs in AP under the custody of BC Muslims like Nagoor Meera, Noor Basha, Dudekula etc. The Pak sponsored fundamentalist orgn’s like Jamat-e-Islam & Tabliq-e-Islam want to demolish all of them to establish their supremacy at the behest of the ruling party.
