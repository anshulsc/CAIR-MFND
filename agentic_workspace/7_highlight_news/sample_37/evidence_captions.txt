*Muslims beat up Udaipur Paras Choraya police after issuing challan to them. Which is a challenge to the law. This video tells what will happen in India in future. Who will run the country? And what will be everyone's future? The bitter truth is that the country faces more danger from within than from outside.
Even the police are not safe in a so-called Muslim area! No matter what the mistake of these cops, who appear to be personnel of the traffic police, was—people are saying it was a dispute over a challan (traffic rule violation ticket)—but no one has the right to manhandle them.
Please watch once My dear lovely friends wish you all a happy journey
