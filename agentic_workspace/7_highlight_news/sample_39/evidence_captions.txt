Very infuriating!Waqf Board claim on Siddhivinayak Temple, which is the idol of Hindus and the identity of Mumbai!The Mahavikas Aghadi has given a written consent to the demands of the Ulemas, including the demand for Waqf.If you want to save temples and forts, vote for Mahayuti!
Enough is enough.Abolish Waqf—no more land grabs, no more appeasement! Reclaim all lands and return it to rightful owners!!!
Hindus in #Maharashtra Congress govt will happily make this claim true if you elect #MahaVikasAghadi sarkar.That’s why it’s important to vote for #MahayutiSarkar 
WAQF board now claims Siddhi Vinayak temple of Mumbai
WTFQ Board has crossed all limits.
