Maulana Sajjad Nomani was given a helicopter by Congress, Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray to travel all over Maharashtra...crores were spent on it! He put forward his 20 demands through a press conference and released the demands in writing in the press. These were very dangerous demands like... RSS should be banned, a Muslim should become the Deputy CM, Wakf Board should be given complete freedom and 1 lakh acres of land in Maharashtra should be given to Wakf Board.
