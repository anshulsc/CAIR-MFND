<strong>Drinking around 2 liters of water per day (about 8 cups) can thin out the mucus in your lungs</strong>, making it easier for you to expel the mucus when you cough. Drinking warm liquids such as tea, vegetable broth, or warm water will help thin the mucus and make it easier to cleanse your lungs.
