Let us pray together: <strong>Almighty God, we come before You in the name of Jesus Christ, lifting up our brother and sister who are in need of Your mercy and grace</strong>. They are caring for their family and preparing for exams, and we ask that You strengthen them in their responsibilities and studies.
