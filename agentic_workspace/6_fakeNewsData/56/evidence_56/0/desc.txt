Tradition has it that on this day, <strong>Lord Krishna lifted Govardhan Hill to give shelter from torrential rains to local villagers</strong>. Today, Hindus prepare a great deal of food and take it to the temples to celebrate the beginning of the new year and give thanks to Krishna for his benevolence.
