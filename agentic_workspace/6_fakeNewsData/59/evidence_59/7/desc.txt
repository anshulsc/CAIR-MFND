Having slept with more than 1,300 <strong>prostitutes</strong>, at a cost of £115,000, kindly allow me my convictions. I remember the first time I had sex—I still have the receipt. The <strong>girl</strong> was alive, as far as I could tell, she was warm and she was better than nothing. She cost me £20.
