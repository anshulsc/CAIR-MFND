This is Sardar Mohan Singh, who fought for Germany in the 2nd World War. After winning the war, when Hitler wanted to reward him, Sardar ji said that give us the best weapons, because we have to liberate our country. The weapons that Hitler gave him, the same weapons were used by the Azad Hind Fauj and in reality, in this war, the British decided to leave India only after more than 50 thousand British soldiers were killed in Rangoon. Gandhi and Congress had no contribution in this. Later these Congressmen gave all the credit of independence to Gandhi's spinning wheel. The name of a great warrior like Sardar Mohan Singh disappeared from the history of India.
